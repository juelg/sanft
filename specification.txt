1.  Introduction

   Contrary to other file transfer protocols, in SANFT, clients can
   request arbitrary portions of files from the server at their own
   leisure.  This eliminates the concept of connections, making it the
   client's responsibility to properly request and assemble files while
   freeing the server from the burden of keeping state.  It is hence a
   rather simple and flexible protocol, defining only a minimum set of
   functionality to ensure the seamless interaction of all participants.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  SANFT

2.1.  Overview

   SANFT messages are sent in User Datagram Protocol packets [RFC0768].

   If a client wants to download a file from a server using SANFT, it
   usually starts by sending a Metadata Request (MDR) containing the
   name of the requested file to the server.  The server answers this
   request with a Metadata Request Response (MDRR) that contains general
   information about the file such as the file size, a unique file
   identifier, and a checksum of the file.

   After obtaining these data from the server, the client can proceed to
   request individual portions of the file by sending
   Chunk Requests (CRs) to the server, which the server will answer with
   Chunk Request Responses (CRRs) containing the respective part of the
   file.

   Once the client has obtained the entire file, it MUST verify that the
   transfer was successful by computing the checksum.

   Since SANFT is a stateless protocol, the responses sent by the server
   (MDRR and CRR) will generally echo a client-chosen number field from
   the header of the corresponding request by the client (MDR or ACR) to
   indicate which request is being answered.

2.2.  Header

   Each SANFT message starts with a header.  Messages sent by the client
   (MDR and ACR) start with a client header, while messages sent by the
   server (MDRR and CRR) start with a server header.

                       Figure 2: Server Header Format

   The headers contain the following fields:

   Version  The version of the protocol.  For this specification, the
      version field MUST be set to zero.

   Type  The message type, according to the following mapping:

      0 - New Token Message (NTM)
      1 - Metadata Request (MDR)
      2 - Metadata Request Response (MDRR)
      3 - Agregate Chunk Request (ACR)
      4 - Chunk Request Response (CRR)

   Number  Whenever the client sends a request to the server, the client
      sets the Number field to a freely-chosen value.  When the server
      responds to a respective request, it MUST set the number field in
      its response to the value specified in the client request that
      prompted the response so that the client may identify the request
      which the responds answers.

   Token  A client MUST include a token, which was received from the
      server earlier (see Section 2.3).  If the client does not have a
      token, then the client MUST include a arbitrary value.

   Error  An error code.  Error codes are defined per message type.  If

      no error occurred, this field MUST be set to zero.

2.3.  New Token Message (NTM)

   To protect against misuse of the system via address spoofing, the
   server MUST generate a 256-bit token based on the client's IP address
   and port number, which the client MUST include in every request.  The
   client obtains a valid token from the server by making a request with
   an invalid token (i.e. an arbitrary value).  Once the server receives
   an invalid token from the client, it responds with a New Token
   Message (NTM).  The sever MUST NOT send any responses apart from the
   NTM when receiving a request with an invalid token.  Token generation
   is left open to the server implementation, since the client simply
   has to include a copy of the token in requests but does not have to
   decipher it.  For example, the token MAY be the HMAC of the IP
   address and port number of the client.  If the server changes any
   keys used to generate the token, future requests based on the old key
   will be invalid, and thus clients will receive updated tokens
   automatically after their next request.  If the client changes IP
   addresses, the token will be invalid and thus the client will receive
   a new token which is valid for the new IP address from the server
   (see Section 7.4 for more details).

   The server SHOULD replace any keys used for token generation every 12
   hours to improve security.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 3: New Token Message Format

   The NTM consists of the following field:

   Token  The 256 bit field for the token, which is generated by the
      server.  The client MUST include it in the subsequent message
      headers.

   Whenever the client receives a New Token Message it MUST use the new
   token for all following requests until another NTM is received from
   the server.

2.4.  Metadata Request (MDR)

   The client can request information about a file from the server via a
   Metadata Request (MDR).

                     Figure 4: Metadata Request Format

   The MDR consists of the following fields:

   File URI  The UTF-8 encoded Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
      [RFC3986] of the file.  This is a variable length field, which
      MUST be longer than zero.

2.5.  Metadata Request Response (MDRR)

   Upon receiving a Metadata Request from the client, the server SHOULD
   respond with a corresponding Metadata Request Response (MDRR).

      be larger than 0 and MUST NOT be larger than 65,517.

   Max Chunks in ACR  The maximum number of chunks the client may
      request in a single ACR (see Section 2.6).

   File ID  A unique numeric value specific to the file which the
      response describes.

   File Size  The size of the file in chunks.

   Checksum  A binary SHA265 checksum of data in the file.

   The server MUST respond with the following error codes in the header
   if the corresponding conditions apply:

   1 - Unsupported Version  The server does not support the protocol
      version specified in the client's request.  In this case, the
      server MUST set the version field in its response to the highest
      version it supports.
   2 - File Not Found  The server does not provide any file with the
      given filename.

   If more than one of the above conditions apply, the server MUST
   respond with the lowest applicable error number.  When responding
   with an error, the server MUST omit all fields in the MDRR that are
   not part of the header.

2.6.  Chunk Request (CR) and Aggregate Chunk Request (ACR)

   The client MAY request portions of a file by sending a Chunk Request
   (CR) to the server.

                       Figure 6: Chunk Request Format

   The CR contains the following fields:

   Offset  The position of the first requested chunk in the file (i.e.
      the number of the first chunk).

Internet-Draft                    SANFT                        July 2022


   Length  The number of consecutive chunks requested (starting from the
      first chunk).  This field MUST NOT be zero.

   CRs are always embedded in Aggregate Chunk Requests (ACRs).  Each ACR
   can hold any number of CRs between one and the value specified in the
   Max Chunks in ACR field of the MDRR.

      pertain as indicted by the server in the MDRR.

   Packet Rate  The Packet Rate measured by the client in packets per
      second (see Section 5).

2.7.  Chunk Request Response (CRR)

   Upon receiving a CR from the client, the server SHOULD respond with a
   corresponding Chunk Request Response (CRR).  When answering a ACR,
   the server MUST answer the individual CRs in the order in which they
   appear in the ACR.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                  Figure 8: Chunk Request Response Format

   The CRR contains the following fields:

   Chunk Number  The number of the chunk in the file which the client
      requested.

   Data  The data contained in the corresponding chunk.  The size of
      this field is equal to the chunk size specified in the MDRR,
      unless the server is answering a request for the last chunk in the
      file, which may be smaller if the overall file size is not a
      multiple of the chunk size.

   The server MUST respond with the following errors codes in the header
   if the corresponding conditions apply:

   1 - Unsupported Version  The server does not support the protocol
      version specified in the client's request.  In this case, the
      server MUST set the version field in its response to the next
      lower version it supports.
   2 - Invalid File ID  There is currently no file on the server that is
      associated with the File ID sent by the client.
   3 - Too Many Chunks  The number of requested chunks in the ACR
      exceeds the value specified in the Max Chunks in ACR of the MDRR.
   4 - Chunk Out of Bounds  The chunk requested by the client is not
      within the file.
   5 - Zero length  The length field in the CR contains a zero value.

   If more than one of the above conditions apply, the server MUST
   respond with the lowest applicable error number.  When responding
   with an error, the server MUST omit all fields in the CRR that are
   not part of the header, with the exception of the Chunk Out of Bounds
   ?
   error (4), where only the Data field MUST be omitted, while the Chunk
   Number field MUST NOT be omitted.

Internet-Draft                    SANFT                        July 2022


   If only errors 4 or 5 apply, the server SHOULD continue to process
   the remaining CRs in the ACR.  On the other hand, if any of the
   errors 1-3 apply, the server MUST NOT respond to any of the remaining
   CRs in the ACR after sending the error.

3.  Measurements

   The client takes two measurements -- Response Time and Packet Rate --
   during the transfer process, which are used for loss detection
   (Section 4) and congestion control (Section 5).

   The Response Time (RT) is the time between sending the request and
   receiving the first message of the response.  For the ACR, where one
   request leads to many response messages, the time to the first
   received related response is measured.  The client MUST record the
   Response Time for every successful request it sends.

   The Packet Rate is the number of packets per second that the server
   will try to send at.  It is measured over the time of one ACR
   response, meaning the block of CRRs send by the server following an
   ACR.  The Packet Rate is an average over the entire response,
   specifically the number of packets received divided by the time
   between the first and the last message (n/delta_t).  (The inverse of
   this would be the average time between packets.)

   Since the Packet Rate is based on the first and the last message of
   the block (which are known by both parties as the server answers CRs
   in the order in which they appear in the ACR) the client MUST
   estimate their expected arrival time based on the requested rate if
   these packets are lost.  These estimations are based on the smallest/
   highest message received (based on the ordering in the corresponding
   ACR) and can be calculated as follows:

   time_estimated_first = time(smallest) - (smallest - 1) / rate

   time_estimated_last = time(highest) + (#CR - highest) / rate

   where :

   *  rate is the value of the Packet Rate field sent in the ACR;

   *  smallest (resp. highest) is the index of the CRR with the smallest
      (resp. highest) index that was received, the index of the first CR
      in the ACR being 1;

   *  time(smallest) (resp. time(highest)) is the time at which the CRR
      with the smallest (resp. highest) index was received;

   *  #CR is the number of CRs in the ACR;

   *  time_estimated_first (resp. time_estimated_last) is the estimated
      time of arrival of the response to the first (resp. last) CR in
      the ACR.

4.  Loss Detection

   There are two possible ways how loss can occur in our system.  Either
   the client receives no response at all or out of the multitude of
   responses to the ACR a few are missing.

4.1.  Client gets no CRR at all from the server

   The client can assume now its request has gotten lost.  This case is
   detected with a timeout which is either two times the Response Time
   or 3 seconds; the latter being the case if the RT has not been
   measured yet, for example in the first request.  After the timeout
   the client SHOULD retransmit the request.  This timeout is further
   restricted by server side flow control (see Section 6)

4.2.  Client gets at least one CRR

   After receiving the first CRR packet to an ACR from the server, the
   client MUST maintain a timer which is always set to the expected
   arrival of the last CRR pertaining to this ACR.  Should the timer
   time out, all expected CRRs that have not yet arrived are considered
   lost and MAY be re-requested by the client in the next ACR.  The
   client MAY ignore any CRR that arrives after the end of the
   corresponding timer.  The client can calculate this timeout based on
   the requested Packet Rate it sent in the ACR (see Section 5).  The
   formula for this utilizes the total number of Chunk Requests in the
   ACR (#CR), the position of the last received request in the ACR
   (last), the requested Packet Rate (rate) and a small buffer to ensure
   an appropriate waiting time is given for the last message (buffer):
   (#CR - last + buffer) / rate

   The client MUST use this formula to restart the timer whenever a new
   CRR arrives.  The client knows the sending order of the server based
   of the order of the CRs in the ACR.  The restarting of the timer
   minimizes the accumulated difference between the actual rate of the
   network and the requested rate .

   The buffer SHOULD be set to at least 3 further messages.  This way
   the client waits for three "virtual" messages to arrive before
   deciding the missing messages of the response got lost.  This
   correlates with the TCP idea of 3 duplicate ACKs signaling loss of a
   packet.

   Note that the calculated expected time it would take for the
   remaining packets to arrive is a conservative estimate as the server
   adds an additional constant to the rate as described in Section 5.

5.  Congestion Control

   As described in Section 2.6 the client always includes a sending rate
   in all ACR messages.

   For the first ACR the client can pick an arbitrary rate which MAY be
   link or RT dependent.  For all following ACR the client MUST use the
   measured Packet Rate described in Section 3.

   The server SHOULD increase this requested rate by a constant factor
   and send all CRRs pertaining to this ACR at the resulting rate.

   We assume that the network's congestion is directly correlated with
   its ability to deliver messages at a given rate.  If the network
   experiences congestion it delays or drops packets leading to a lower
   rate.  This new rate is then considered the rate in which the network
   is able to send given its current congestions.  Using this new rate
   for following packets ensures that the network will not be congested
   even more by our traffic.  Having the server increasing the rate
   constantly ensures that we also adapt to relaxing congestion and peak
   for higher potential possible rates.  Thus, this mechanism can
   successfully adapt to fluctuating network congestion.

   This strategy follows an Additive Increase and Multiplicative
   Decrease (AMID) congestion control mechanism shared between the
   client and the server.  The rate is additively increased by the
   server each time the client sends a new ACR.  Loss on the other hand
   leads to a multiplicative decrease of the measured Packet Rate.  This
   mechanism ensures that even when the rate measurement fails to
   prevent packet loss, the algorithm falls back to a proven solution to
   congestion control.

6.  Flow Control

6.1.  Client Side Flow Control

   The client MUST NOT request more data than it can handle.  If it can
   handle more at a specific point in time it MAY also send further
   request while the server is serving the old request.

6.2.  Server Side Flow Control

   There is no explicit flow control on the server side.  The server MAY
   chose to drop whole requests when it is overloaded.  However, it MUST
   NOT stop answering a single ACR which it has already sent out
   responses to.  To prevent overloading the server further, the client
   MUST use an exponentially increasing backoff for repeated requests.
   The client MUST double its waiting period (initially 2*RT or 3
   seconds) for each further repetition.  The client MAY decide to
   cancel the transfer and inform the user of the failure after a couple
   of retries.

7.  General Considerations

7.1.  Checksum verification

   Once a client has requested and received every chunk for a file, the
   client MUST compute the SHA256 digest of the received file.  If the
   computed digest does not match the checksum provided in the Metadata
   Request Response for the file, the client SHOULD delete the received
   data and MAY request the file anew.

7.2.  File change

   If a file on the server changes, the server MUST generate a new File
   ID and provide it in responses to further Metadata Requests for the
   changed file.  The server MAY continue to serve previous versions of
   a file when a Chunk Request with an old file ID is received.

   However, the server MAY also choose to return an Invalid File ID
   error and refuse to serve old versions.  In that case the client MUST
   delete the received data, send a new metadata request for the file
   and request data with the newly provided file ID.

7.3.  File deletion

   If a file on the server is deleted, the server MUST answer every
   further Metadata Request for the deleted file with a File Not Found
   error with a File Not Found error code.

   The server MAY continue to serve CRs for the deleted file over a
   transitional period to ensure that clients may complete downloads
   that are already in progress.

7.4.  Connection migration

   If the client's IP address changes, it MUST continue to send with the
   old token.  Upon receiving the now invalid old token, the server will
   issue a new token with the New Token Message.  Thereafter, the client
   MUST use the new token to resume the file transfer and for all
   subsequent requests made by the client.

7.5.  Connection drop

   The protocol does not create any connection session between the
   client and the server.  Therefore, even if the connection between the
   server and the client is lost for an extended period of time, the
   client MAY resume the file transfer by requesting the missing chunks.
